This project is my, Pranav Narahari, implementation of UNO using Java and IntelliJ.
This project is a large scale project with multiple classes uses concepts such as polymorphism, abstract classes and methods, and unit-testing.
I approached this project using the TDD process, i.e. Test Driven Development. 
Classes, methods, and variables are commented where there exists ambiguity and there is special attention to the primary functionality of the project.

A full description of all the functionality is decribed in the files of the projects, but a summary of all the functionalities is stated below:
This interpretation of the game UNO is a 2-10 (inclusive) player game where there exists regularly numbered cards, reverse cards that reverse the order in which players take their turns, skip cards which allow players to skip other players, draw2 and draw4 cards which penalize the following players, and wild cards which allow you to create restrictions of the following cards.
